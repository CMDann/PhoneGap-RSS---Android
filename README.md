This is and Android application that was built using PhoneGap. PhoneGap is a framework for developing native applications that are essentially web apps. This is useful for small compaines that want to give you a feed to their posts and events that is directly from their website.

This is also useful for creating cross platform apps that are identical but require you to deploy on iOS and Android.
